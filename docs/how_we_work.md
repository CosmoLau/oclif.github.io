title: How We Work
---

oclif is an open-source project built and maintained by Salesforce and an essential component of Salesforce's developer experiences, powering millions of users' CLIs a day via the Salesforce CLI, the Heroku CLI and [others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/@oclif/core).

As an open-source project, [oclif repos live on GitHub](https://github.com/oclif) and are published to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=oclif).

## Code of Conduct & Community Guidelines

We are thrilled to offer oclif as open-source. As such, please review our project [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/salesforce/oss-template/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). If you have any questions or concerns, please [contact us](feedback.md).

## Issues

Issues are made in their corresponding repo as appropriate. If you are unsure which repo an issue might belong to, make an [issue in the oclif repo](https://github.com/oclif/oclif/issues).

We triage issues as we can, usually with a week of when it was created (unfortunately, we can make no commitment to when an issue will be triaged).

An issue will be considered stale after a month has passed with no further feedback or input from the author after input from an oclif team member. Stale issues will be notified with a comment of its stale state and any actions needed to take to keep it alive.

An issue will be closed if:

* It has been fixed via a PR
* Has a “wont-fix”, “invalid” or “duplicate” label
* A week has passed after a stale issue notification has been posted with no further feedback or input from the author

## Pull Requests

We review repo PRs as we can, usually with two weeks of when it was created (unfortunately, we can make no commitment to when a PR will be reviewed).

PRs reviewers may seek additional changes or clarifying input from the author as appropriate.

Note: It is often more conducive to first open an issue and solicit feedback on possible solutions for your PR. We hate to see PR’s we don’t end up accepting and this helps to avoid that!

A PR will be considered stale after a month has passed with no further feedback or input from the author after input from an oclif team member. Stale PRs will be notified with a comment of its stale state and any actions needed to take to keep it alive.

* It has been merged
* After a dialogue with the author informing them why the PR cannot be accepted
* A week has passed after a stale PR notification has been posted with no further feedback or input from the author
